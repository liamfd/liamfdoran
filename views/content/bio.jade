	p.
		Hello, I'm a web developer, and I want to build websites in New York. I'm currently
		a student at Trinity College, Hartford, a few months from finishing a BS in Computer Science.
		I'm interested in backend, frontend, and full stack development, as well as tools I have never tried.
		I also write when I can, and dabble in improv comedy.
